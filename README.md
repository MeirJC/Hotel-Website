> # Hotel-Website

---

A demo project on a hotel website using HTML-CSS.
this project basic tamplate is taken from a udemy course of "Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)" by Brad Traversy that taken a while ago and really liked.

Now I have gotten back to to review it, I added some modifications and better content to make it more "real-life" example instead of just lorem-ipsum etc'.

This is strictly for learning purpose, this is not a real hotel. all details are fictional.

live demo available [here](https://hotel-bt-website-meirjc.netlify.app/)
